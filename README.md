# Outlyer CLI

The Outlyer CLI enables users to import and export their entire account configuration as a local folder structure and YAML files. This enables users to support several use cases easily:

- The ability to update and edit their account configuration via code and push updates when performing releases
- The ability to version control all their account configuration via Git
- The ability to export all their check/plugin configuration to deploy to the agent via Configuration Management

## Installation / Usage

The installation steps and usage are described in the Outlyer documentation.
